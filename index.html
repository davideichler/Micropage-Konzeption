                <h1>about & context</h1>
                <p>beat ubiquity is an interactive sound installation in which users are able to experience the surrounding of furtwangen in a unique and unconventional way. different objects are connected to the computer, various sounds and matching visuals can be triggered by touching those objects. all sounds and all visuals are created out of recordings and photos we took from different locations in our environment, which we subsequently distorted, manipulated and rearranged. however, those sounds and visuals appear in such an abstract way when getting triggered through the objects representing each one of them. the user is going to experience furtwangenÂ´s ubiquity in the most unfamiliar way.</p>
                <p>we had this idea of creating a new way to experience all those things we face every day subconsciously. our goal was to make a project representing the town we live where users can interact with an application in order to witness their daily environmental impulses in a new fun way. thus, we recorded various sounds and took many pictures walking through furtwangen and edited them afterwards to get an abstract style. we had a lot of fun working on this project and would like to experiment with other tools which may help us by adding further features, enhancing an immersive experience we are aiming for.</p>

                <p> - fl studio 21 [sounddesign & beat] <br> - adobe photoshop, illustrator, premiere pro, photomosh [audiovisuals] <br> - p5.js, javascript [application & prototype] <br> <br> the interaction is handled by a tool called makeymakey. this tool allows us to create a virtual instrument by touching any object plugged to the makeymakey. moreover, we found some objects which represent each sound and visual to make it overall a more coherent experience for the user. the objects are placed on a table and connected to the makeymakey, whilst the matching visual will be projected on a wall. our installation appeals acoustically, visually and haptically to the user which makes it a highly interactive and thanks to its sounds and visuals magnificently unconventional.</p>
