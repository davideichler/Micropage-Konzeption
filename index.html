                <h2>about</h2>
                <p>beat ubiquity is an interactive sound installation in which users are able to experience the town of furtwangen in a unique and unconventional way. whilst different objects are connected to a makey makey, various sounds and matching visuals can be triggered by touching those objects with the makey makey cable. all sounds and all visuals are created out of recordings and photos we took from different locations in our environment which we subsequently distorted, manipulated and rearranged. however, those sounds and visuals appear in such an abstract way when getting triggered through the objects representing each one of them that the user is going to experience furtwangenÂ´s ubiquity in the most unfamiliar way.</p>

                <h2>context</h2>
                <p>we had this idea of creating a new way to experience all those things we face every day subconsciously. our goal was to make a project representing the town we live where users can interact with an application in order to witness their daily environmental impulses in a new fun way. thus, we recorded various sounds and took many pictures walking through furtwangen and edited them afterwards to get an abstract style. <br>  we had a lot of fun working on this project and would like to experiment with other tools which may help us by adding further features enhancing an immersive experience we are aiming for.</p>

                <h2>used setup</h2>
                <p>fl studio 21 for sounddesign. adobe photoshop, illustrator, premiere pro, photomosh for audiovisual contents. p5js, javascript were used for the application. the interaction is handled by a tool called makey makey. this tool allows us to create a virtual instrument by touching any object pluged to the makeymakey. moreover, we found some objects which represent each sound and visual to make it overall a more coherent experience for the user. the objects are placed on a table and connected to the makey makey, whilst the matching visual will be projected on a wall. our installation appeals acoustically, visually and haptically to the user which makes it a highly interactive and thanks to its sounds and visuals magnificentally unconventional.</p>
